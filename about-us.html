                <h2>What we are</h2>
                <p>Melboudne legal is a nationally recognized, dynamic and result oriented law firm, providing a full range of legal services to commercial and private clients.  It is a firm that was born out of the vision of HNG internship to build and establish a vibrant law firm with unequivocal under-pinnings on principles of honesty and non-exploitation of both staff and clientele.  
                The firm aspires to become a pillar of efficient and un-paralleled legal practice and expertise, large enough to handle the multinational conglomerates, yet modest and caring enough to grant audience to the financially challenged, yet aggrieved members of society, whose rights have been abrogated unlawfully. 
                In envisioning its future, the firm is committed to ensuring that the services it provides not only meet but exceed the needs of its customers.</p>


                <p>Our laws were created to protect and empower us but many people don't get the help they need because of costly legal fees and complexity.
                    At Melbourne Lawyer, we want to change things by making legal services affordable and available to more people than ever before. We dedicate our time and resources making it easier for people to get the legal help they need, so they can focus on what's really important—taking care of their families and building strong businesses.

                    We're in the business of providing clarity and help that is always available and accessible whether you use our simplified self-guided legal services or work with one of our fantastic independent attorneys, or both, we've got your back.

                    We are technology driven individuals whose aim is to provide a model of a platform that
                    would enable legal organisations especially in the country to be able to
                    deliver legal services to their clients using the internet. It also offers
                    clients with information about different types of legal services and the
                    requirements needed. This will help the client to be able to gather
                    information needed to get a legal service from the firm, preparing all
                    answers and documents ready before placing an order to the firm.

                the initiation of the lawyer-client relationship to the final delivery of legal
                services and payment to the firm for those services online. Access to legal
                services online can provide an ongoing relationship between the firm and
                the client that provides superior customer service and long-term legal
                care beyond traditional delivery methods.
