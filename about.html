                  <h1>About Us</h1>

                  <p>Save The Amazon rainforest Foundation is a non-profit foundation which started as a task in the 2019 session of the StartNG Pre-internship Program sponsored by Flutterwave. We are dedicated to ensure and promote the conservation of, and right now, help combat the spread of the fire currently raging in the Amazon rainforest, an ecosystem on which the world depends.</p>

                  <h1>About The Amazon</h1>
                  <p>The Amazon is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. It is the largest rainforest in the world, roughly half the size of the United States and is key to the health of the entire planet. Estimates show that nearly 20% of the oxygen produced by the Earth's land comes from the Amazon rain forest. It also puts an enormous amount of water into the atmosphere at a time when cities are drying up. The Amazon sucks in carbon and greenhouse gases while slowing the rising temperatures. But now, it's burning at a record rate with images from space showing the smoke covering much of Brazil. Something needs to be done.</p>
                  <br><br>

                  <h1>Help Us Save The Amazon</h1>
                  <p>You can help reforest parts of the world through the Save The Amazon rainforest Foundation. The Foundation allows you to restrict your donations to a specific project. We ensure 100% of your donation will help stop the Amazon rainforest fire and deforestation in Brazil right now. We are working with local groups at the forefront of this fight. Part of the Foundation's work strives to make South America's current ranches and farms more productive and raise awareness on the importance of aforestation. We want a healthier world for every one of us.</p>
