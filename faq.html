                    <h1 class="question">What is STAF?</h1>
                    <p>Save The Amazon rainforest Foundation is a non-profit foundation which started as a task in the 2019 session of the StartNG Pre-internship Program sponsored by Flutterwave.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="question">What distinguishes STAF from other rainforest organisations?</h1>
                    <p>STAF is exclusively focused on the Amazon Rainforest given its vital importance to global biological and environmental ecosystems. Also, it unleashes the power of collaboration and capacity building to create a template for rainforest conservation methods.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="question">How does STAF fund itself?</h1>
                    <p>STAF being a non-profit is dependent on grants and funding from donors like the United Nations and consulting for governments and organisations with strong interests in environmental conservation and biological ecosystems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="question">Why should nature be preserved?</h1>
                    <p>Protecting the wildlife also means that you are preserving it for the future generations. It helps in promoting biodiversity for a healthy and functional ecosystem. We humans can also benefit from protecting wildlife because a lot of medicines can be derived from the chemicals produced by animals and plants.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="question">Why should I join STAF</h1>
                    <p>We are all protected and governed by nature. A healthy environment provides nutrients that flow up the food chain, from plants to animals, to provide energy. STAF gives you the opportunity to do just that.</p>
