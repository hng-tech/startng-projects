    	<h2>TECHNOLOGIES FOR DISABILITY</h2><br>

    	<p>Assistive technology is designed to help students who have learning disabilities. Whether students have physical impairments, dyslexia or cognitive problems, assistive technology can help them to function within the classroom. These tools include any type of equipment or device that helps students to compensate for their learning disabilities. While they are unable to eliminate learning problems entirely, they can help students to capitalize on their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Among the most innovative technologies available today, the following five are the most popular.</p><br>
    	<ol>
    		<b><li>Electronic Worksheets</li></b><br>

    			<p>Students with learning disabilities like dyslexia can use electronic worksheets to complete their assignments. These worksheets help students to line up words, equations and numbers on their assignments. On some of the worksheets, text-to-speech or speech synthesizing technology is even available.</p><br>

    		<b><li>Phonetic Spelling Software</li></b><br>

    			<p>For many children with learning disabilities, reading and writing can be a challenge. Phonetic spelling software is designed to automatically convert the student’s typing into the word that they intended to write. For alternative reading options, students can always check out audiobooks. With the audiobook, students can follow along in their text and overcome reading difficultie</p><br>

    		<b><li> Talking Calculators</li></b><br>

    			<p>Students who have dyscalculia can benefit greatly from a talking calculator. The gadget makes it easier to check assignments, read numbers and perform calculations. While the talking calculator is a fairly simple tool, it offers an exceptional benefit for students who would otherwise struggle in math classes. Other than talking calculators, students can also check out text-to-voice devices. They function on the same concept of converting written words into an audible track. Students can use these devices to check their spelling or to improve their reading comprehension skills.</p><br>

    		<b><li>Variable Speed Recorders</li></b><br>

    			<p>Everyone has a different learning style, and many students struggle with understanding auditory lectures. For these students, a variable speed recorder is an ideal solution. In essence, the student just has to hit record while they are in class. Afterward, the recording can be slowed down or sped up for the student to listen to it again and again. If the pitch of the recording is hard to understand, students can modify the pitch up or down to make their lectures more accessible.</p><br>

    		<b><li>Videotaped Social Skills</li></b><br>

    			<p>Autistic children and other children with learning disabilities may struggle to figure out normal social interactions. In the past, the most common way to learn social interactions was to practice them. Unfortunately, many children inadvertently behaved inappropriately as they tried to learn what defined “normal” social interactions. With videotaped social interactions, students can learn important life skills and social behavior without accidentally offending someone. In addition to interpersonal skills, these videos can work for self-help, linguistic, academic and emotional problems as well.
				Learning disabilities can manifest in a variety of different ways. From mild disabilities to debilitating problems, these disabilities affect the student’s ability to learn and take part in a classroom. Unfairly stigmatized in popular culture, it is now possible to use technology to overcome many learning disabilities. From offering students ways to slow down the lecture to providing talking calculators, these technological devices are able to meet the student’s unique needs. With help, students can become the competent, exceptional individuals that they already have the potential to be.</p>

    		<h3>Technology milestones for different ages</h3><br>
    	<p>With a little effort, it is possible to use technology in thoughtful ways that support children’s development. Take a look at these technology milestones to get ideas for positive media use at every age.</p>
    	<br>
    <h3>Technology milestones for toddlers</h3>	<br>
    	<p>Though screen time isn’t recommended for children under 18 months old, the AAP does make one exception: video calls. Video chatting with friends and relatives is recognized as “quality time interacting with others,” according to KidsHealth. Toddlers aren’t ready to use apps on their own, but with help from adults, they can be introduced to the idea of sharing, taking turns and using technology to encourage movement and gross-motor skills.</p>
    	<br>

    	<b><p>With these points in mind, here are some tech milestones to aim for with toddlers:</p></b>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Use video conferencing apps to connect toddlers with far-away family and friends.</li>
    		<li>Arrange a “video playdate” between your children and their friends.</li>
    		<li>Introduce the idea of taking turns by showing toddlers that only one finger at a time can control a tablet or smartphone.</li>
    		<li>Join children in a dance party with the help of kid-friendly music apps.</li>
    		<li>Help toddlers use a dance choreography app, like Toca Dance to coordinate their own dance routine, then follow along in real life</li>
    	</ul>
    	</div>

    	<div class="rs-part5">
    		<h3>Technology milestones for preschoolers</h3><br>

    	<p>Imaginative play and emerging creativity are a key part of preschoolers’ development. Contrary to popular belief, screen time doesn’t have to stifle creativity. In fact, Puerling has found that certain apps can actually enhance this age group’s imaginative play.</p>
    	<p>“It’s really important to have conversations with kids about what we can use technology for: to create videos, to take photographs, and then put our own creative spin on them,” Puerling says.</p>
    	<p>These are some ways you can use technology to encourage creativity and collaboration</p>
    	<ul><br>
    		<li>Use stop-motion video technology (such as the I Can Animate app) to encourage children to bring a story to life using clay figures or other toys.</li><br>
    		<li>Bring children together as digital pen pals and hone their teamwork skills by having them write and animate a collaborative story using an app like ChromaKids.</li><br>
    		<li>Encourage kids to write and star in their own theatrical productions by filming their onstage adventures, then adding special effects and even a soundtrack to create the final movie</li>
    	</ul><br>
    <h3>Technology milestones for grade-schoolers</h3><br>

    	<p>“There’s a lot of talk about what skills are going to be necessary in the workforce,” Puerling says. Though no one can predict exactly how technology will continue to expand, Puerling believes that creativity, collaboration, problem-solving skills and coding abilities will serve kids well as they grow older—all skills that are being developed in grade-schoolers. This is also a time to encourage children’s emerging literacy.</p>
    	<p>Elementary school is the perfect time to use technology to enhance these skills using techniques like these:</p>
    	<ul><br>
    		<li>Present kids with programmable robot games like Robot Turtles and Cubetto no screens needed, since kids will learn directional programming through movement. </li><br>
    		<li>Use drag-and-drop apps, like Daisy the Dinosaur, to introduce the basics of coding and build literacy skills by introducing high-frequency words.</li><br>
    		<li>Offer interactive e-books or videos with captions to capture kids’ curiosity and promote early literacy.</li>
    	</ul>
